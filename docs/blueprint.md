## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark teal (#008080) to convey a sense of sophistication and the classic, green felt of the tables. 
- Background color: A very dark grayish-teal (#222B2B), nearly black, will support the dark mode design, let the teal accents pop, and communicate quality.
- Accent color: A light sea-green (#3EA99F) that's a somewhat brighter analog to the primary, for focus and contrast.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif. Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif.
- Use billiard-themed icons for table management and revenue sections.
- Design a mobile-friendly layout with a clean and simple interface.
- Subtle transitions and animations on data updates and timer events.
